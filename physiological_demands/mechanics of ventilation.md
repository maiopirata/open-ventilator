# Definitions and important points
* the air in the lungs is saturated with water vapor at 37 degrees (**BTPS**).
* `tidal volume` [L]: volume of air entering and leaving the lungs. Tipically ~500 mL
* `total ventilation` [L/min]:  tidal volumes multiplied frequency of breath 
* `Expired lung volume` [L]: the volume exiting the lungs (1%>than that entering the lungs because of metabolic use of O2.

# Pulmonary mechanics
Physics applied to study how air moves in and out the lungs, generating a change in lung volume (VL).
There are `static` and `dynamic` properties.

# Static properties
* barometric pressure (Pb): 760 mmHg 
* 1 mmHg = 133.3224 Pa
* lungs tend to collapse because of their `elastic recoil`.
* thoraci cage as an elastic recoil that pulls outoward.
* `intrapleural space` is where the two pressures are balanced. The space is small (5-35 um) and fluid. Intraplural pressure `Pi` is less than barometric pressure, hence a relative vacuum.
* `Pi` is not uniform in the lungs.
* Gravity influences the gradient of Pi in the lungs, e.g. typical static values `after a quiet respiration` (standing): 
    * Pb = 760 mmHg (101,325 Pa)
    * Pi ~ 753 mmHg (~100,392 Pa) on the proximal side of the lungs
    * Pi ~ 759 mmHg (~101,192 Pa) at the base of the lungs
* Lying would generate a smaller gradient between ventral and caudal sides of the lungs.
* **NOTE:** it is customary to express `Pi` pressions in `cmH2O` wrt `Pb = 0 cmH2O`. So:
   * Pi ~ -10 cmH2O at apex of lungs (standing)
   * Pi ~ -2.5 at the base (standing)
* `functional residual capacity`: the volume of the lungs in static condition. Around 3L in healthy individuals.
