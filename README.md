# open-ventilator
An open source project for a low cost medical ventilator.

## disclaimer
This device has not been tested yet and it can be used only understanding the possible implications. We are not trying to reproduce a professional medical ventilator. We are just trying to produce low cost highly available alternative.

## motivation
We are hearing from multiple sources that ventilators are out of stocks. Our hospitals need to keep up with the growing number of people requiring mechanical ventilation.
The design has to only allow for the use of parts already produced for mass production.

## contribution
Everybody is free to open a PR with proposed improvement. Please notice that we are doing this outside of our normal job and in different timezones.

## sponsoring
We are currently figuring out if we can accept sponsors or help. Right now we are just doing this out of our free time.
